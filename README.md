# Lecture-Note-Generator

This is a script I use to quickly create a Markdown file for taking notes at university. 

The script itself must be edited before use so that pre-determined modules fill the modules list.

This script and the Markdown template should sit in a folder alongside folders for each module. Each *module* folder must contain a folder called "Lecture Notes"; this is where the generated files are placed.

For me, `\Documents\University\Second Year\` contains seven folders (named **CO510 Software Engineering**, **CO518 Algorithms, Correctness and Efficiency**, etc.), the **Lecture Note Template.md** file, and the **University Lecture Note Generator.py** file. Each of the seven folders contains a folder called **Lecture Notes**, and each of these contains a series of files such as **CO510 190923 Intro to CO510.md**.
